## Project Description

The app allows the user to scan a company's logo with their phone to generate an overlay in AR that describes the eco-friendliness of said company.

This is done for conveience during shopping as well as to recommend more sustainable companies having similar products.

The app also allows the user to work towards goals to be more eco-friendly and keep track of such progress.

**Core Features** - logo recoginition, recommending similar companies, community eco-friendly goals and progress of such goals

## Inspiration 

There is a lack of apps that focus on promoting eco-friendly behaviour and sustainable small companies over larger companies. 

We thought that users might be interested in learning more about the eco-friendliness of a company before purchasing products from them. 

We also thought that having goals to work towards to be more eco-friendly would help promote more of this type of behaviour.

## How we built it

**Swift 4** - iOS app

**Core ML** - Logo recoginition 

**AR Kit** - AR display of company sustainability 

**Sketch** - Wireframing for UI/UX

## Challenges we ran into

**ARKit** - first time using AR Technology

**Machine Learning** - several problems trying to integrate a tensorflow model into the iOS app



## What's next for BlindSight

**Android App** - to increase user base

**Personalized recommendations** - based on users scans
